      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The UI/UX design process is a step-by-step approach to designing products that provide a great user experience (UX) and look visually appealing (UI). It helps designers understand users, solve real problems, and create useful, easy-to-use, and enjoyable products. This process is often based on Design Thinking.</p>

      <h2>1. Empathize</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Understand the users and their needs.</li>
        <li><strong>How:</strong> Through interviews, surveys, observations, or user research.</li>
        <li><strong>Why it matters: </strong> To design something helpful, we need to feel what the users feel.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>2. Define</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Clearly state the problem you’re solving.</li>
        <li><strong>How: </strong>Use insights from the empathize stage to write a clear problem statement.</li>
        <li><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Without a clear direction, your design may not actually help users.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>3. Ideate
        </h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Goal: </strong> Come up with creative ideas to solve the problem.</li>
        <li><strong> How:</strong> Brainstorming sessions, mind maps, or sketching.</li>
        <li><strong>Why it matters: </strong> The more ideas, the better the chance of finding a smart solution.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>4. Prototype
        </h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Goal: </strong> Build a simple model of your idea.</li>
        <li><strong>How: </strong> Create wireframes, mockups, or clickable prototypes using tools like Figma.</li>
        <li><strong>Why it matters:</strong>  To turn ideas into something visual and interactive.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>5. Test
       </h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong> Goal: </strong> Get feedback from real users.</li>
        <li><strong> How:</strong> Ask users to try the prototype and observe what works and what doesn’t.</li>
        <li><strong>Why it matters: </strong> Testing helps improve the design and ensures it solves the user’s problem.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The UI/UX design process is all about designing with the user in mind. By following the steps — Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test — designers can create products that are not only useful and attractive but also solve real problems. It's an iterative process, meaning you can go back and forth between steps to keep improving your design.</p>
